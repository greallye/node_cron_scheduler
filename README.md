# node_cron_scheduler
Create a cron job on the frontend, and node will schedule this run at the selected time. You will notice at the moment the code will call a console.log() at the requested time. Replace this to run whatever you require.


## Installation

```shell
$ npm install
```

## Running

run locally
```shell
$ node scheduler.js
```

If running this on a server

```shell
$ [sudo] npm install forever -g
```

```shell
$ npm start
```
